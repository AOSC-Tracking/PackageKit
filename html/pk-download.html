<h1>Where do I download it?</h1>

<p>
Your distribution may already have compiled packages that are much
easier to install.
<ul>
  <li>Conary: Yes, just run: <code>sudo conary update-all</code></li>
  <li>Fedora 8: Yes, just install <a href="http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/fedora/">this</a> repository file and run: <code>yum install PackageKit gnome-packagekit</code> (as root)</li>
  <li>Others: Probably not, although you can compile from source. See the download <a href="">page</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
PackageKit itself is an abstract daemon, the only bits that are distro
specific are the backends.<br/>
To make PackageKit work on a new distribution, you have to write a
"backend" which is basically a shim layer from the distro tool to
packagekitd. A backend can have one or more threads and also spawn other processes.<br/>
See the developer information <a href="moo">here</a> for loads more
information.
</p>

<p>
Backends do not have to be complete; often they just contain basic
functionality to install and remove but do not provide dependency or file
lists for example.
For instance:
</p>
<ul>
<li>yum (95% complete)</li>
<li>conary (70% complete)</li>
<li>apt (40% complete)</li>
<li>box (10% complete)</li>
<li>pacman/alpm (10% complete)</li>
</ul>

<p>
We need people to create backends, and then package (pardon the pun)
PackageKit and gnome-packagekit for more distributions.
I think it's important that installing and updating software should be
as easy as possible.
