QPackageKit is a library to control the PackageKit [1] daemon. It's written in
pure C++/Qt, and abstracts the DBus interface so that it's easy to interact
with the daemon.
This lib needs PK > 0.3.5

There's also a gitweb here :

Requirements :
All you need to build the lib is cmake, and Qt4. You will need CppUnnit if you
want to build the unit tests, which you most likely don't.

Build and install:
It's always better to build in a separate folder. In the root folder, do :
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
then you can run the standard make / make install procedure
If you want to build the unit tests, run cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=1 ..

All bugs/suggestions should be reported to madcat AT mymadcat DOT com
