The name of this backend is apt2.

It supports apt which is mainly used by Debian and its derivates. In contrast to
the backend called apt this one uses DBus for the communication with the 
packagekit daemon. This allows to perform actions without having to reopen
the cache for each one.

To provide a tremendously fast search function a Xapian database is used.
It is provided by Enrico Zini's apt-xapian-index. Debtags will be used to 
enhance the quality of the search results further.

A list of implemented functions are listed in the PackageKit FAQ:

http://www.packagekit.org/pk-faq.html

You can find packages for Ubuntu here:

Packages for Debian Unstable will be provided soon.

Feel free to send comments or bug reports to the PackageKit mailing list
or to the author.
