ISSUES:

 * Support delayed or hidden debconf questions

Unresolved issues can be discussed at the following wiki page:
http://wiki.debian.org/PackageKit


TODO:

 * Implement all open backend methods. A list of implemented backend methods 
   can be found in PackageKit FAQ or in pk-backend-apt2.c.

 * Blacklist packages requiring input on the terminal and try to change
   the Debian policy in the long run. Way of automation?
 
 * Allow to inject alternative apt.package.Package classes into the
   cache to support PackageKit and distribution specific needs
   (e.g. when is a package called free or supported)

 * Allow to reinject debtags into the search results to get 
   similar software which not matches on the search terms

 * Index file list and add properties for package name and section to
   the xapian database to also make use of it in search group and 
   search name (do we want this?)

 * Map Debian/Ubuntu sections to PackageKit groups:
    - admin : System Administration 		=> admin-tools
    - base : Base System 			=> system
    - comm : Communication			=> communication
    - devel : Development 			=> programming

  The following could not be maped: science, documentation, electronics
  Are there any derivates with additional sections?

 * Fix the dbus policy. Should we require at_console for searching?
