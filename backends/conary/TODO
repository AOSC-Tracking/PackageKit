* the XML cache doesn't include all packages (e.g. ubuntu-font-family/automake)
  - there is probably bugs in the tool ('ticache') that generates the cache.
* should support system model
  - the conary-api related code should all be put in conarypk.py
  - Note: some allow_cancel/status() calls may be lost when moving the code.
  - implement search
* fix use of post_process and implement _pkg_compare in conaryFilter.py
  - http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/packagekit/2011-March/006245.html
* update conaryCallback.py to base on new callbacks
  (conary/cmds/updatecmd.py:UpdateCallback) so it can handle system-model.
* a bug (seems in conary?):
  - sudo conary install gitweb --> "install gitweb" in /etc/conary/system-model
    (right)
  - sudo conary erase gitweb --> "install gitweb" becomes "erase gitweb"
    (wrong; the line should be just deleted)
