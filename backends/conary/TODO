* the XML cache doesn't include all packages (e.g. ubuntu-font-family/automake)
  - there is probably bugs in the tool ('ticache') that generates the cache.
* should support system model
  - the conary-api related code should all be put in conarypk.py
  - Note: some allow_cancel/status() calls may be lost when moving the code.
* fix use of post_process and implement _pkg_compare in conaryFilter.py
