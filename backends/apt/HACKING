The backend can be tested by running it as root from the source code
repository. Use the -t/--takeover command line switch to kill a perhaps already
running apt backend before:

  sudo python aptDBUSBackend.py --debug --takeover

Use the --help command line switch for more details.

Some of the development takes place in python-apt. Since this means using 
not yet released code the corresponding work is done in PackageKit's 
apt-consolidate branch and in python-apt's consolidate branch.

bzr branch lp:~glatzor/python-apt/consolidate

Just place a symlink to the apt directory of the consolidate branch working
directory to the apt backend directory.
