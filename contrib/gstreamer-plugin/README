README:

PackageKit installs missing GStreamer plugins as it requested: this is how
the whole system is designed to work.

Introduction:

 1. Package installs pk-gstreamer-install into /usr/libexec
 2. _If_ the distro wants PackageKit to handle the codec install, and
    not an application like codeina then you need to symlink
    pk-gstreamer-install to gst-install-plugins-helper
 4. Distribution patches /etc/PackageKit/Vendor.conf with URLs to wiki pages.
 3. Done. It's really that simple.

Notes:

 * You will need to restart any applications using GStreamer before they will
   request plugings using PackageKit.
 * Although PackageKit 0.3.4 supports codec installing, 0.3.6 is the first
   release that returns the correct return valus to GStreamer.
