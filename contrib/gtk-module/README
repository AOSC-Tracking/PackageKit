The GTK+ module is designed to be loaded using gnoms-settings-daemon by the
gnome-packagekit package.

It can however be lauched for testing using:

GTK_MODULES="$GTK_MODULES:/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/modules/pk-gtk-module.so" application

Pango will callback with any languages which need installing, and these
are queued up. In an idle callback these are emitted as a asyncronous DBUS
method to the session InstallFonts() method.

If configured to do so, this will prompt the user to install new fonts.

Notes:

 * At the moment the window XID is not sent, which means focus stealing
   prevention may not work properly. We're working on this.
