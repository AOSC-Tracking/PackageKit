~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 0.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Backends:
 - Add a new python based APT backend (Ali Sabil)
 - Significant smart backend updates (James Bowes)
 - Significant PiSi backend updates (S.Çağlar Onur)
 - More yum functionality (James Bowes, Tim Lauridsen)
 - More box functionality (Grzegorz Dabrowski)

* New features:
 - Allow PkClient to be set promiscuous, i.e. to report all activity and use to
   get the errors and completions (Richard Hughes)
 - Add pk-backend-python.[c|h], for common spawning functions for python
   backends and switch the backends to use them (James Bowes)
 - Use pk_strzero, pk_strlen and pk_strcmp to increase performance and
   potentally improve security (Richard Hughes)
 - Add resolve support to pkcon get depends/requires/description/updatedetail
   (S.Çağlar Onur)
 - Try to guess the remaining time of the transaction using a super nifty
   algorithm (Richard Hughes)
 - Add Cleanup and Obsoleting as info states so we don't scare the user with
   DELETING when they are doing an upgrade (Richard Hughes, Tim Lauridsen)

* API changes:
 - Switch the discrete GetPercentage and GetSubPercentage to a GetProgress
   method that allows us to report remaining and elapsed time into the
   client UI (Richard Hughes)

* Bugfixes:
 - Sanitise more text from the backends in case the backend sends invalid or
   malicious text (Richard Hughes)
 - Defer destroying the backend for 5 seconds so we can query it in the
   finished handler in clients (Richard Hughes)
 - Add GetFiles method so we don't slow down the GUI box getting the file list
   every time we click a package (James Bowes)
 - Calculate progress bar length based on terminal columns (James Bowes)
 - Convert RefreshCache to a privileged operation but with default to allow
   when on active console. The distro can then patch this default to whatever
   depending on the security policy - and the admin can of course change the
   default. (S.Çağlar Onur)

Version 0.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New backends:
 - A SMART backend (James Bowes)
 - A PiSi backend (S.Çağlar Onur)

* New features:
 - A better, easier to use website; http://www.packagekit.org (Richard Hughes)
 - Added missing install-file.py so we can do local rpm installs (Tim Lauridsen)
 - Be ultra-paranoid about validating input from the user (Richard Hughes)
 - Send SIGQUIT and then SIGKILL after a little delay, so we can clean up the
   backends nicely by unlocking when we cancel (Richard Hughes)
 - Add resolve functionality in pkcon to allow non-package_id use, for instance
   'pkcon remove gimp' now does the right thing (Richard Hughes)
 - Display a pulsing progress bar for no-progress-updates and percentage-update
   that is shown when using a console (James Bowes)
 - Remove the hard dependency on NetworkManager so other networking stacks
   can be used instead (S.Çağlar Onur, Richard Hughes)
 - Add a filter parameter for Resolve() so we can do the filtering in the
   spawned backend without duplicating code (James Bowes, Richard Hughes)
 - Substantial additions to the box backend (Grzegorz Dabrowski)
 - Add GetRepoList and RepoEnable to the yum backend (Tim Lauridsen)
 - Add bash completion script for pkcon (James Bowes)
 - Get the repo list for the aplm backend (Andreas Obergrusberger)

* API changes:
 - Store the transaction database in /var/lib rather than /var/db (James Bowes)
 - Don't expose the private list in PkTaskList, instead use verified functions
   to ensure we can't corrupt data accidentally (Richard Hughes)
 - Don't export the private data array in PkClient or PkPackageList - this
   breaks API, so the library version has been bumped (Richard Hughes)

* Bugfixes:
 - Fix the resolve method parameter passing - now pk-install-package should work
   correctly (James Bowes)
 - Fix all the copyright notices to be a standard GPL2+ boilerplate licence
   text (Tom Parker, Robin Norwood)
 - Dist the local apt headers so the apt backend can be compiled from a tarball
   rather than just from git (Richard Hughes)
 - Fix a 1-in-10 random daemon startup crash when backends do libnm_glib init,
   shutdown, init, shutdown repeatedly (Richard Hughes)
 - Added locking in the yum backend to allow simultaneous use of the yum command
   line tool or yum-updatesd (Tim Lauridsen)
 - Fix NoPercentageUpdates validity checking (James Bowes)
