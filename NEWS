Version 0.1.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Backends:
 - yum: Mark our status as QUERY when we have finished setting up the
   transaction so we get the correct icon (Richard Hughes)
 - yum: Improved yum UpdateMetadata handling for reboot-suggested (Luke Macken)
 - conary: Add GetFiles (Elliot Peele)
 - conary: Enable Cancel (Elliot Peele)
 - conary: Add Resolve support (Elliot Peele)
 - conary: Added new python files to distfiles (Ken VanDine)
 - zypp: add initial backend code (Boyd Timothy, Scott Reeves)
 - zypp: Add GetRepoList (Boyd Timothy)
 - zypp: emit the correct status from the backend (Boyd Timothy)
 - zypp: Add InstallPackage method (Boyd Timothy, Scott Reeves)

* New features:
 - Lots more waf build system updates - it now builds and installs 100%
   but requires waf from svn (Gustavo Carneiro, Daniel Svensson, Richard Hughes)
 - Add the requires check before remove in pkcon (Richard Hughes)
 - Monitor when the calling program exits from the system bus (Richard Hughes)
 - waf: Add unit test reporting in waf buildsystem (Daniel Svensson)
 - Convert all the active methods async. This lets us get the sender so we can
   watch to see if they fall off the bus or not (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a yum-packagekit plugin to refresh the PackageKit data when a manual
   update command is run. Code is copied from yum-updatesd in yum-utils and
   was authored by James Bowes.
 - Install the bash completion file so it works by default (Richard Hughes)
 - Add into pkcon to get the time since something was checked (Richard Hughes)
 - Log when the last command is run so we can work out how long since a command
   was run. This allows us to accuratly preseve the "session" setting of
   GetUpdates policy (Richard Hughes)

* API changes:
 - Add a status enum so we get the correct icon when getting data (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a info enum for blocked updates (Richard Hughes)
 - Add some more status constants for backend transaction progress (Richard Hughes)

* Bugfixes:
 - Use a different PolicyKit permissions for UpdateSystem and UpdatePackage
   as both were defined as the same thing in the policy (Richard Hughes)
 - Build fixes with autogen.sh (Tom Parker, Boyd Timothy)
 - Free memory in case of dbus error (Grzegorz Dabrowski)
 - Fix a crash in pk_transaction_list_get_array (JP Rosevear)
 - We should only invalidate the internal cache if the transaction succeeded.
   This stops a failed update-system from clearing the cache (Richard Hughes)
 - Fix the manpage corruption issue described in Bug #12796 (Luke Macken)

Version 0.1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Backends:
 - smart: Add installed filter (James Bowes)

 - yum: Add get-update-detail (Tim Lauridsen)
 - yum: Add get-requires (Tim Lauridsen)
 - box: Use C API with percent updates for cache refreshing (Grzegorz Dabrowski)

 - Add enums builder for python (Tom Parker)
 - Add the start of a waf build system - untested and unsupported.
   (Richard Hughes, Alberto Ruiz, Daniel Svensson)
 - Add initial work for multiple apt searching backends (Tom Parker)

* API changes:
 - PkClient restart should be an enumerated type, not free text (Richard Hughes)

* Bugfixes:
 - Replace the g_strjoinv and use pk_strbuild_va to append a va_list to fix
   a crash on i86_64 (Richard Hughes)
 - Immediate exit has to wait a few cycles for registration (Richard Hughes)
 - Check for existance of apt_pkg python module with apt backend (Tom Parker)
 - yum: Emit no-cache in resolve if the cache is invalid (Tim Lauridsen)
 - Correct typos and thinkos, and add a few more application notes to the
   developer documentation (Richard Hughes)
 - Fix memleaks in a few places of the daemon code (Grzegorz Dabrowski)
 - Fix memleaks in PkClient and PkJobList (James Bowes)
 - Don't emit error for the transaction if cancel is not valid - cancel
   operates on an existing tid and shouldn't have control of the finished or
   error signals (Richard Hughes)
 - Parse updatedetail from stdout and discover get_update_detail (Richard Hughes)
 - Update packagekit.pc.in to require glib and gobject (Tom Parker)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 0.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Backends:
 - Add a new python based APT backend (Ali Sabil)
 - Significant smart backend updates (James Bowes)
 - Significant PiSi backend updates (S.Çağlar Onur)
 - More yum functionality (James Bowes, Tim Lauridsen)
 - More box functionality (Grzegorz Dabrowski)

* New features:
 - Allow PkClient to be set promiscuous, i.e. to report all activity and use to
   get the errors and completions (Richard Hughes)
 - Add pk-backend-python.[c|h], for common spawning functions for python
   backends and switch the backends to use them (James Bowes)
 - Use pk_strzero, pk_strlen and pk_strcmp to increase performance and
   potentally improve security (Richard Hughes)
 - Add resolve support to pkcon get depends/requires/description/updatedetail
   (S.Çağlar Onur)
 - Try to guess the remaining time of the transaction using a super nifty
   algorithm (Richard Hughes)
 - Add Cleanup and Obsoleting as info states so we don't scare the user with
   DELETING when they are doing an upgrade (Richard Hughes, Tim Lauridsen)

* API changes:
 - Switch the discrete GetPercentage and GetSubPercentage to a GetProgress
   method that allows us to report remaining and elapsed time into the
   client UI (Richard Hughes)

* Bugfixes:
 - Sanitise more text from the backends in case the backend sends invalid or
   malicious text (Richard Hughes)
 - Defer destroying the backend for 5 seconds so we can query it in the
   finished handler in clients (Richard Hughes)
 - Add GetFiles method so we don't slow down the GUI box getting the file list
   every time we click a package (James Bowes)
 - Calculate progress bar length based on terminal columns (James Bowes)
 - Convert RefreshCache to a privileged operation but with default to allow
   when on active console. The distro can then patch this default to whatever
   depending on the security policy - and the admin can of course change the
   default. (S.Çağlar Onur)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 0.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New backends:
 - A SMART backend (James Bowes)
 - A PiSi backend (S.Çağlar Onur)

* New features:
 - A better, easier to use website; http://www.packagekit.org (Richard Hughes)
 - Added missing install-file.py so we can do local rpm installs (Tim Lauridsen)
 - Be ultra-paranoid about validating input from the user (Richard Hughes)
 - Send SIGQUIT and then SIGKILL after a little delay, so we can clean up the
   backends nicely by unlocking when we cancel (Richard Hughes)

   'pkcon remove gimp' now does the right thing (Richard Hughes)
 - Display a pulsing progress bar for no-progress-updates and percentage-update
   that is shown when using a console (James Bowes)
 - Remove the hard dependency on NetworkManager so other networking stacks
   can be used instead (S.Çağlar Onur, Richard Hughes)
 - Add a filter parameter for Resolve() so we can do the filtering in the
   spawned backend without duplicating code (James Bowes, Richard Hughes)
 - Substantial additions to the box backend (Grzegorz Dabrowski)
 - Add GetRepoList and RepoEnable to the yum backend (Tim Lauridsen)
 - Add bash completion script for pkcon (James Bowes)

 - Don't expose the private list in PkTaskList, instead use verified functions
   to ensure we can't corrupt data accidentally (Richard Hughes)
 - Don't export the private data array in PkClient or PkPackageList - this
   breaks API, so the library version has been bumped (Richard Hughes)

* Bugfixes:
 - Fix the resolve method parameter passing - now pk-install-package should work
   correctly (James Bowes)
 - Fix all the copyright notices to be a standard GPL2+ boilerplate licence
   text (Tom Parker, Robin Norwood)
 - Dist the local apt headers so the apt backend can be compiled from a tarball
   rather than just from git (Richard Hughes)
 - Fix a 1-in-10 random daemon startup crash when backends do libnm_glib init,
   shutdown, init, shutdown repeatedly (Richard Hughes)

   line tool or yum-updatesd (Tim Lauridsen)
