  <title>Developer FAQ</title>
  <para>
    The following sections explain frequently asked questions from people creating thier own
    backend.
    This list is not exhaustive, but please ask before adding to it.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="developer-faq-status-signals">
    <title>Backends should send status signals...</title>
    <para>
      If your backend does not set status signals you will get the following dialog:
    </para>
    <mediaobject id="pk-faq-status">
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata format="PNG" fileref="pk-faq-status.png" align="center"/>
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
    <para>
      For every transaction, you need to tell the datemon what the backend is doing.
      You need to add to your backend:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          For python: <literal>self.status(STATUS_QUERY)</literal>
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          For compiled C/C++: <literal>pk_backend_set_status (backend, PK_STATUS_ENUM_QUERY);</literal>
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      You can send as many status calls as you need as the transaction progresses.
      The more calls you send, the more the UI will reflect what is being done, for instance,
      showing a downloading icon when <literal>PK_STATUS_ENUM_DOWNLOAD</literal> is used.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="developer-faq-error-code-finished">
    <title>Finished() after ErrorCode()...</title>
    <para>
      If your backend does not send <literal>Finished()</literal> after <literal>ErrorCode()</literal>
      then the following dialog will be shown.
    </para>
    <mediaobject id="pk-faq-error-code">
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata format="PNG" fileref="pk-faq-error-code.png" align="center"/>
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
    <para>
      The daemon recovers automatically, so this warning is not fatal, but the automatic recovery
      is not cost free.
      Every time the daemon cleans up a transaction like this, an additional 500ms is added to the
      transaction duration (to allow slow backends to clean up after themselves) and so the
      next transaction is delayed from starting.
    </para>
    <para>
      You need to ensure that <literal>Finished()</literal> follows <literal>ErrorCode()</literal>
      to remove this warning.
    </para>
  </sect1>
