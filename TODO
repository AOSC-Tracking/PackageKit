Order of no particular importance:

* yum-find-name.py has to emit full version and epoch, not just the version
* Use libgbus in PkNetwork to avoid warning message
* Add a queing API
* Add GetStatus and ::StatusChanged to get package data as string for UI
* Add details into the application UI
* Add runtime into finished signal
* Write documentation for UI porters
* Add FindPackagesByGroup() and GetGroupList perhaps
* Add a way to import GPG keys
* Add       <arg type="b" name="filter_development" direction="in"/>
* Add enough new error enums for the yum backend
* Add sub-percentage support into API
