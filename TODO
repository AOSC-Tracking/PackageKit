Order of no particular importance:

*** pk-notify-icon (client) ***
Do automatic updates at login time when system has gone idle
 * needs gnome-screensaver integration
NOTE: RELEASE BLOCKER

*** Add new callback for status ***
TimeRemaining()
 
*** Get the deps in the UI when removing ***
We really don't want to remove glibc...
NOTE: RELEASE BLOCKER

*** pk-application (client) ***
Use an icons for installed and not-installed rather than tickboxes
Refresh the query list after an install or remove (means saving the query and re-issuing)

*** Prepare download to refresh system ***
Either use a flag or a new method. I'm not sure which yet.

*** Add a way to import GPG keys ***
In fedora, if you add a signed repo you have to agree to the GPG key.

*** Split up PolicyKit install into different types ***
Have different permissions for signed and unsigned repos.

*** Add files in package into Description signal ***
We need a way to get the installed files into the UI.

*** Add package size into description signal ***
We need a way to work out how long something is going to take, and
to expose in the UI.

*** task_client has to return GError ***
Client programs using libpackagekit should know the error, rather than just
"it failed"

*** Log what was installed/removed and when ***
Need to monitor the Package's emitted by the task and encoded to a string

*** Handle rollbacks for select backends ***
To do rollbacks sanely in PK we need a few things:
 * emit internal signal for SetTransactionData
 * write pk_transaction_id_equal to not compare data
 * allow transaction data to be changed in _db
 * use an new method to handle the rollbacks and pass it to the backend
