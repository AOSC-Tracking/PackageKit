Order of no particular importance:

* Use libgbus in PkNetwork to avoid warning message
* Make the backend documentation clearer
* Add a queing API
* Add GetStatus and ::StatusChanged to get package data as string for UI
* Complete the yum backend (or at least bodge it for now)!
* Add details into the application UI
* Add runtime into finished signal
* Write documentation for backend writers -search-details.*
* Write documentation for UI porters
* Add FindPackagesByGroup() and GetGroupList perhaps
* Add RequireRestart(s=system,application,session,s=detail)
* Add a way to import GPG keys (and add error enum gpg-key-required)
* If PK crashs in the middle of a pk-application method then stop job and
  report an error to the user.
