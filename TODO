Order of no particular importance:

*** Make the daemon aware on how long between updates ***
Requires writing to a database for config stuff
 - Probably should move the job number stuff there too
New method GetHoursSinceLastUpdate
Use this in the update icon

*** Add new callback for status ***
TimeRemaining()

*** Prepare download to refresh system ***
Either use a flag or a new method. I'm not sure which yet.

*** Add a way to import GPG keys ***
In fedora, if you add a signed repo you have to agree to the GPG key.

*** Split up PolicyKit install into different types ***
Have different permissions for signed and unsigned repos.

*** Handle rollbacks for select backends ***
To do rollbacks sanely in PK we need a few things:
 * allow transaction data to be changed in _db

*** Use resolve for pkcon operations ***
'pkcon install zsh' should work as well as 'pkcon install "zsh;1.0;i386;repo"'

print matched too many, quit
for each length
print get_item(client, 1)

case: INSTALL
if not a valid package_id then
    pacakge=command_resolve(package, ENUM_AVAILABLE);

    }

*** Unit tests ***
PkSpawn is a complex and untested bit of code.

*** backend docbook ***
Explain SIGQUIT and SIGKILL in the docs
