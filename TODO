Order of no particular importance:

*** Add a queing API ***
Jobs need to be queued so that read only jobs can be done in parallel,
but write jobs are done in serial. Maybe spawn each task and put it into a
paused state?
NOTE: RELEASE BLOCKER

*** Have to have an UpdatesChanged signal ***
For the icon to update after we've done a system upgrade
NOTE: RELEASE BLOCKER

*** Add a way to import GPG keys ***
In fedora, if you add a signed repo you have to agree to the GPG key.

*** Split up PolicyKit install into different types ***
Have different permissions for signed and unsigned repos.

*** Add files in package into Description signal ***
We need a way to get the installed files into the UI.

*** Add package size into description signal ***
We need a way to work out how long something is going to take, and
to expose in the UI.

*** Get Transactions ***
Do we use a job number? Finished?
Need to convert the role to an enum

*** task_client has to return GError ***
Client programs using libpackagekit should know the error, rather than just
"it failed"

*** Add logging so we can see what was installed/removed and when ***
Depends on transaction_id and sqlite integration.

*** Add "when installed" and "installed by" data into UI ***
Is this useful?

We would need to store package_id,installed_by,when_installed in a sqlite database
*** Dummy backend should use subpercent and install deps ***
It's not a great test case right now...

*** Handle rollbacks for select backends ***
To do rollbacks sanely in PK we need a few things:
 * convert the job into a transaction_id
 * save the transaction_id's and descriptions to a database
 * add a method to get the transaction_id's in the last x transactions
 * write an application that can see the description of the transactions
 * use an new method to handle the rollbacks and pass it to the backend
