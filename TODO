*** Timeframe: 0.1.11 ***

* Make PkMessages into proper enumerated types with localised descriptions

* Add a way to import GPG keys for unsigned packages
  In fedora, if you add a signed repo you have to agree to the GPG key.

*** Timeframe: 0.2.0 ***

* Make the dbus interface sane
  Preview available in src/pk-interface-transaction.xml

* Make installing firmware with udev possible
  http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/packagekit/2008-March/002430.html

* Enable GetUpdateDetail to handle arrays for 'updates' and 'obsoletes'
  Until then, use a space to delimit package_id's

* Add the GetPackages(filter) method to get the complete package list
  Then add a group menu item for this in pk-application

* Make one-click installs work

* We need more unit tests.
  Where we can actually simulate _using_ packagekit, probably using an
  enhanced dummy backend and libpackagekit.
  This is a tricky one as we can't assume we have the
  org.freedesktop.PackageKit.conf file installed in the system prefix -
  maybe we can #ifdef the daemon to run in the session bus for some
  testing.

*** Timeframe: Sometime in the future ***

* Split up PolicyKit install into different types
  Have different permissions for signed and unsigned repos.

* Fix ServicePack to work correctly:
  http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/packagekit/2008-March/002434.html

* Handle rollbacks for select backends, i.e. allow transaction data to be changed

* Don't display install if something is upgradable
  Return update when we search for something that is installed, but an
  update exists for
