Order of no particular importance:

*** Make the daemon aware on how long between updates ***
Requires writing to a database for config stuff
 - Probably should move the job number stuff there too
New method GetHoursSinceLastUpdate
Use this in the update icon

*** Add a way to import GPG keys ***
In fedora, if you add a signed repo you have to agree to the GPG key.

*** Split up PolicyKit install into different types ***
Have different permissions for signed and unsigned repos.

*** Handle rollbacks for select backends ***
To do rollbacks sanely in PK we need a few things:
 * allow transaction data to be changed in _db

*** Make resolve easier to use ***
resolve in pkcon has to check for installed package already - and not
display a cryptic message when already installed
