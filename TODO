Order of no particular importance:

*** Have to have an UpdatesChanged signal ***
For the icon to update after we've done a system upgrade
NOTE: RELEASE BLOCKER

*** Add a way to import GPG keys ***
In fedora, if you add a signed repo you have to agree to the GPG key.

*** Split up PolicyKit install into different types ***
Have different permissions for signed and unsigned repos.

*** Add files in package into Description signal ***
We need a way to get the installed files into the UI.

*** Add package size into description signal ***
We need a way to work out how long something is going to take, and
to expose in the UI.

*** task_client has to return GError ***
Client programs using libpackagekit should know the error, rather than just
"it failed"

*** Log what was installed/removed and when ***
Need to monitor the Package's emitted by the task and encoded to a string

*** Handle rollbacks for select backends ***
To do rollbacks sanely in PK we need a few things:
 * write an application that can see the description of the transactions
 * use an new method to handle the rollbacks and pass it to the backend
