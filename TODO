Order of no particular importance:

*** write to the database for config stuff
 - Probably should move the job number too

*** package->status ***
Convert the backends to send more status calls.

*** Add a way to import GPG keys ***
In fedora, if you add a signed repo you have to agree to the GPG key.

*** Split up PolicyKit install into different types ***
Have different permissions for signed and unsigned repos.

*** Handle rollbacks for select backends ***
To do rollbacks sanely in PK we need a few things:
 * allow transaction data to be changed in _db

*** Make resolve easier to use ***
resolve in pkcon has to check for installed package already - and not
display a cryptic message when already installed
