Order of no particular importance:

* yum-find-name.py has to emit full version and epoch, not just the version
* Add a queing API
* Add GetStatus and ::StatusChanged to get package data as string for UI
* Write documentation for UI porters
* Add FindPackagesByGroup() and GetGroupList perhaps
* Add a way to import GPG keys
* Add s=filter:
  	"installed" or "!installed"	if the package is installed on the system
  	"devel" or "!devel"		devel packages typically end -devel, -dgb and -static.
  	"gui" or "!gui"			gui programs typically depend on gtk, libkde or libxfce.
  So valid would be
  ""					all packages installed or available with no filtering
  "devel;!installed"			all non-installed development packages
  "installed;!devel"			all installed non-development packages
  "gui;!installed;!devel"		all non-installed, non-devel gui programs
  Note: the filtering is done in the backend for efficiency reasons.
  Feel free to add this into the compiled backend if this is not possible in the
  scripted backend.
* Add depth into FindPackage to get rid of find-details
	s=scope
	name				package name
	all				any information
* Add enough new error enums for the yum backend
* Add sub-percentage support into API
* Split up PolicyKit install into different types
* Add FindPackagesByFile(s=fullpath)
* Add files in package into Description signal
* Add conary backend
* Install does not work for the yum backend (code error, not backend error)
* Dummy backend should use subpercent and install deps
