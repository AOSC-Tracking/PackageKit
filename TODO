Order of no particular importance:

* Make installing firmware with udev possible:
  http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/packagekit/2008-March/002430.html

* Fix ServicePack to work correctly:
  http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/packagekit/2008-March/002434.html

* Find out why yum doesn't output some package status calls.

* Make PkMessages into proper erumerated types with localised descriptions

* We need to make sure the html documentation is still correct and easy
to read - does any of it sound like technobabble? Is it easy enough for
developers to get detailed information about how to contribute?

* We need to audit all the strings in gnome-packagekit so that they are
easily localisable and don't contain markup. This is one for you if you
are also a translator.

* We need some yelp documentation for the gnome-packagekit tools. This
will mean getting screenshots and generally explaining how to use the
tools.

* We need a proper security audit of the packagekitd daemon. We are
running as root, so we need to make sure we are not doing anything
insane that would mean we could crash and do bad things.

* We need more unit tests where we can actually simulate _using_
packagekit, probably using an enhanced dummy backend and libpackagekit.
This is a tricky one as we can't assume we have the
org.freedesktop.PackageKit.conf file installed in the system prefix -
maybe we can #ifdef the daemon to run in the session bus for some
testing.

*** write to the database for config stuff
 - Probably should move the job number too

*** Add a way to import GPG keys ***
In fedora, if you add a signed repo you have to agree to the GPG key.

*** Split up PolicyKit install into different types ***
Have different permissions for signed and unsigned repos.

*** Handle rollbacks for select backends ***
To do rollbacks sanely in PK we need a few things:
 - allow transaction data to be changed in _db

*** Don't display install if something is upgradable
 - Return update when we search for something that is installed, but an
   update exists for
