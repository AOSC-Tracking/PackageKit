Order of no particular importance:

* Lots of the functions are not well commented with gtk-doc. Most
important is to get the libpackagekit/*.c annotated as it's used in
other projects. This is probably quite a boring job but is a good way to
work out how PackageKit is put together.

* We need to make sure the html documentation is still correct and easy
to read - does any of it sound like technobabble? Is it easy enough for
developers to get detailed information about how to contribute?

* We need to audit all the strings in gnome-packagekit so that they are
easily localisable and don't contain markup. This is one for you if you
are also a translator.

* We need some yelp documentation for the gnome-packagekit tools. This
will mean getting screenshots and generally explaining how to use the
tools.

* We need a proper security audit of the packagekitd daemon. We are
running as root, so we need to make sure we are not doing anything
insane that would mean we could crash and do bad things.

* We need more unit tests where we can actually simulate _using_
packagekit, probably using an enhanced dummy backend and libpackagekit.
This is a tricky one as we can't assume we have the
org.freedesktop.PackageKit.conf file installed in the system prefix -
maybe we can #ifdef the daemon to run in the session bus for some
testing.

* The gnome-packagekit tools don't exactly conform the the GNOME Human
Interface Guidelines (HIG). Someone needs to evaluate the GUI tools and
suggest changing some control types, adding key-shortcuts and tooltips
and changing the spacing between widgets where needed.

*** write to the database for config stuff
 - Probably should move the job number too

*** package->status ***
Convert the backends to send more status calls.

*** Add a way to import GPG keys ***
In fedora, if you add a signed repo you have to agree to the GPG key.

*** Split up PolicyKit install into different types ***
Have different permissions for signed and unsigned repos.

*** Handle rollbacks for select backends ***
To do rollbacks sanely in PK we need a few things:
 - allow transaction data to be changed in _db

*** Make resolve easier to use ***
resolve in pkcon has to check for installed package already - and not
display a cryptic message when already installed

*** Don't display install if something is upgradable
 - Return update when we search for something that is installed, but an
   update exists for

*** FIX WAF:
 - build errors
 - build enum.py
 - install the bash completion script
 - install the yum module
